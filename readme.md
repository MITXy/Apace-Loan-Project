# Loan Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict loan defaults using data obtained from Lending Club,CBN website.

## Overview

Lending money is an essential part of the economy, and financial institutions need to ensure that they lend money to people who are likely to repay their loans. In this project, I explore the use of machine learning to predict loan defaults using data from Lending Club. The dataset includes various features such as the borrower's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan amount, and purpose of the loan.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `README.md`: A description of the project.

- `data/`: A directory containing the raw data for the project.

- `notebooks/`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks used to analyze and model the data.

- `models/`: A directory containing any trained machine learning models.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the code.

- `LICENSE`: The license under which the code is released.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the following sources:

- Lending Club: https://www.lendingclub.com/
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/
- Zindi: https://zindi.africa/

The dataset includes information on loans issued by Lending Club, as well as data from Kaggle and Zindi competitions related to loan default prediction.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python (version 3.7 or higher) and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

You may also need to install other libraries depending on the specific techniques used.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the `notebooks/` directory. From there, you can run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and generate the final predictions.

Each notebook contains a description of the techniques used and the performance achieved.
